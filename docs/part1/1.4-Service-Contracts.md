# ‚úÖ **Service Contracts**

## üìò Service Contracts ‚Äì API-First Approach

### üßæ What is a Service Contract?

A **service contract** is a **formal agreement** that defines how a service will behave:

* What endpoints it exposes
* What requests it accepts
* What responses it returns
* What status codes and formats it follows

It‚Äôs like a **blueprint** for how services talk to each other ‚Äî clear, consistent, and agreed upon before building.

### üöÄ What is API-First Approach?

In an **API-First** approach:

> You design the **API contract first**, before writing any code.

This means:

* The API spec (OpenAPI/Swagger, Protobuf, GraphQL schema) is the **source of truth**.
* Development teams can work **in parallel** ‚Äî frontend, backend, QA ‚Äî all rely on the same contract.
* The contract acts like a **mockable stub or scaffold** early in the project.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Commonly Used

* **OpenAPI/Swagger** ‚Äì REST APIs
* **AsyncAPI** ‚Äì Asynchronous/message-driven systems
* **Protobuf** ‚Äì gRPC APIs
* **Postman / Stoplight** ‚Äì API design, testing
* **Pact** ‚Äì Contract testing (Consumer/Provider)

### ‚úÖ Benefits of API-First Approach

| Benefit                       | Description                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| ü§ù **Better collaboration**   | Frontend and backend can develop in parallel           |
| üß™ **Early testing**          | Use mock servers to validate early                     |
| üìö **Auto documentation**     | Docs come from the API definition                      |
| ‚úÖ **Validation & Safety**     | Ensures contracts are followed and changes are tracked |
| üöß **Catch breaking changes** | Prevents accidental API breakage                       |

### üß† Real-World Example

Let‚Äôs say you're building an **Order Service**.

With API-first:

1. You first write the **OpenAPI spec**:

```yaml
paths:
  /orders:
    post:
      summary: Create a new order
      requestBody:
        ...
      responses:
        201:
          description: Order created
```

2. Frontend uses the spec to build UI.
3. Backend uses the spec to generate controllers.
4. QA uses the spec to mock and test early.

## üìò OpenAPI / Swagger / Scalar ‚Äî Simple Explanation

### üåê What is **OpenAPI**?

* **OpenAPI** is a **standard format** (a specification) to **describe REST APIs** clearly and consistently.
* It‚Äôs like a **contract or blueprint** that shows what API endpoints exist, what data they expect, and what they return.
* Written in **YAML or JSON** format.
* Helps tools **generate documentation, client SDKs, and tests automatically**.

---

### üõ† What is **Swagger**?

* **Swagger** is a **set of tools** built around OpenAPI.
* It includes:

  * **Swagger Editor** ‚Äî to write OpenAPI specs.
  * **Swagger UI** ‚Äî to display API docs as a friendly webpage.
  * **Swagger Codegen** ‚Äî to generate client/server code.
* So, **Swagger = tools to work with OpenAPI specs**.

---

### üî° What is a **Scalar**?

* In API schemas (like OpenAPI or GraphQL), a **Scalar** is a **basic data type** that holds a single value.
* Examples of scalars:

  * **String** ‚Äî text like "Hello"
  * **Integer** ‚Äî whole numbers like 1, 42
  * **Boolean** ‚Äî true or false
  * **Float** ‚Äî decimal numbers like 3.14
* Scalars are the **building blocks** of request/response data structures.

---

### üß© How they fit together:

| Term    | What it means                                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAPI | The **specification** for describing REST APIs              |
| Swagger | The **toolset** to create, visualize, and use OpenAPI specs |
| Scalar  | Basic **data types** used inside API definitions            |


## üîô Backward Compatibility

### What is Backward Compatibility?

**Backward Compatibility** means:

> When you **update a service or API**, the new version still **works with older clients or consumers** without breaking them.

In other words, **old clients can keep using the new service without errors.**

### Why is it important in Microservices?

* Multiple services and apps may call your API.
* You can‚Äôt force everyone to upgrade at once.
* You want to **release new features or fix bugs** without stopping old clients.
* Ensures **smooth evolution** of services over time.

### How to maintain Backward Compatibility?

* **Add new fields but don‚Äôt remove existing ones.**
* **Make changes additive, not breaking.**
* **Avoid changing existing data types or request formats.**
* **Support old API endpoints or versions (versioning).**
* Use **default values** for new fields.

### Example:

If your API response used to return:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30
}
```

You can add a new field like:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com"  // new field added
}
```

Old clients ignoring `email` still work fine.

### Summary

Backward Compatibility helps you **improve your microservices without breaking existing users** ‚Äî a key part of good API design!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up Development Environment

### 1. Tools & IDEs

* **Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code** ‚Äî Popular IDEs for microservice development.
* **Postman / Insomnia** ‚Äî API testing tools.
* **Database Clients** ‚Äî e.g., SQL Server Management Studio
* **Logging & Monitoring Tools** ‚Äî e.g., ELK stack, Grafana.

### 2. Docker and Containers

* Install **Docker Desktop** to build and run containers locally.
* Use **Docker Compose** to orchestrate multiple microservices and dependencies.
* Containers package your microservices with all dependencies ensuring consistency across environments.

### 3. Git Repositories

* Use **Git** for version control.
* Host repositories on **GitHub** or other Git platforms.

### 4. Branching Strategy

* Use a branching model to organize work and releases.
* Common strategies:

  * **Git Flow**: Feature branches, develop branch, release branches, main/master branch.
  * **GitHub Flow**: Main branch + short-lived feature branches.
  * **Trunk Based Development**: Frequent small merges to main.
* Branch naming examples: `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/login-error`, `release/v1.0`.

### Tips

* Always **pull latest changes** before starting work.
* Create **pull requests / merge requests** for code reviews.
* Use **.gitignore** files to avoid committing sensitive or unnecessary files.
 
## üåø Different Types of Branching Strategies

### 1. **Git Flow**

* Uses multiple branches: `master` (production), `develop` (integration), feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches.
* Good for complex projects with planned releases and multiple environments.

### 2. **GitHub Flow**

* Simple model with a single `main` branch.
* Developers create short-lived feature branches off `main`.
* After code review, branches are merged back into `main`.
* Ideal for continuous deployment and simpler workflows.

### 3. **Trunk-Based Development**

* All developers work on a single `trunk` (often `main` or `master`).
* Small, frequent commits with feature toggles to manage incomplete features.
* Supports continuous integration and fast delivery.

### 4. **Feature Branching**

* Developers create branches for each feature or bugfix.
* Branches live until feature is complete, then merged back.
* Helps isolate development and reduce conflicts.

### 5. **Release Branching**

* Create branches specifically for preparing releases.
* Stabilize and test release branch before merging to production branch.
* Allows bug fixes without disrupting ongoing development.

### 6. **Forking Workflow**

* Developers fork the main repository to their own copy.
* Make changes in the fork, then create pull requests to original repo.
* Common in open-source projects.
