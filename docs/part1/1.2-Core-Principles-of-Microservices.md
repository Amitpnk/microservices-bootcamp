# 1.2 Core Principles of Microservices

## 🧱 SOLID Principles 

**SOLID** is a set of 5 design principles that help make your software **easy to understand**, **flexible**, and **maintainable**.

| Principle | Name                                      | Simple Meaning                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**     | **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | A class should do **only one job**. Don't mix responsibilities.                                                             |
| **O**     | **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**           | Software should be **open for extension**, but **closed for modification**. Add new code without changing old code.         |
| **L**     | **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**   | A subclass should **behave like its parent**. Replacing the parent with a child should not break the app.                   |
| **I**     | **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** | Don't force a class to implement **unneeded methods**. Use **small, specific interfaces**.                                  |
| **D**     | **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  | Code should depend on **abstractions**, not on concrete implementations. Use interfaces instead of tightly coupled classes. |

## ✅ Other Common Design Principles

| Principle                           | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**     | Don’t copy-paste code. Reuse logic through functions, classes, etc.                             |
| **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**   | Keep your code simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.                                         |
| **YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)** | Don’t build something until you actually need it.                                               |
| **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**    | Keep different parts of the system separate. UI, logic, and data should be in different layers. |
| **Composition over Inheritance**    | Prefer combining small objects over using large class hierarchies.                              |

### 🎯 Why are these important?

These principles help you:

* Write **clean**, **testable**, and **maintainable** code.
* Reduce **bugs**, **duplication**, and **tight coupling**.
* Make your app more **flexible to change**.

## 🧭 Decentralization in Microservices

**Decentralization** means that **each microservice manages its own logic, data, and decisions**, rather than relying on a central system to control everything.

### ✅ What it means:

* **No central brain**: Each service is **independent** and doesn’t wait for a "master service" to tell it what to do.
* **Own database**: Each service has **its own database**, instead of sharing one big database.
* **Own responsibilities**: Each service **handles its own tasks**, rules, and errors.

### 📦 Example:

* In a monolithic app, a central module might handle all payments.
* In microservices, the **payment service** does everything related to payments, including rules, storing data, and processing — **without needing other services** to do it for it.

### 🎯 Why it matters:

* Reduces **tight coupling**.
* Increases **autonomy** and **scalability**.
* Teams can work **independently**.
* Services can be **deployed** or **updated** without affecting others.

## 📈 Scalability and Autonomy in Microservices (Simple Explanation)

### 🚀 Scalability in Microservices

**Scalability** means the ability of your system to **handle more load** (users, data, traffic) by **adding more resources**.

#### ✅ In Microservices:

* You can **scale only the service that needs more resources**, not the whole application.
* Example: If the **"Order Service"** is getting more traffic than others, you can deploy **more instances** of just that service.

#### 🔧 Types of Scalability:

* **Horizontal scaling** – Add more service instances (most common).
* **Vertical scaling** – Give more CPU/RAM to existing instances (limited and expensive).


### 🧠 Autonomy in Microservices

**Autonomy** means each microservice is **independent** and can **make decisions, run, and be deployed on its own**.

#### ✅ In Microservices:

* Services have their **own code, data, and logic**.
* Teams can **build, test, and deploy** their services without coordinating with others.
* Example: The **"Payment Service"** doesn’t need the **"User Service"** to function or deploy.


### 🎯 Benefits:

| Aspect          | Benefit                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability** | Efficient use of resources, performance under high load.         |
| **Autonomy**    | Faster development, independent deployments, fewer dependencies. |


## 📄 API Contracts in Microservices (Simple Words)

### 🧾 What is an API Contract?

An **API Contract** is a **written agreement (or definition)** between microservices that defines:

* What endpoints are available (`/orders`, `/users`)
* What data to send (request)
* What data to expect back (response)
* What status codes might be returned

It’s like a **mutual promise** between services:

> “If you call me like **this**, I will respond like **that**.”

---

### 🤝 Why API Contracts Are Important

In Microservices:

* Services are **independent**.
* They **talk via APIs** (e.g., REST, gRPC, messaging).
* You need a **clear contract** to ensure they communicate correctly.

---

### 📦 Example (Simple REST Contract)

**Order Service API Contract:**

| Method | Endpoint      | Request Body                   | Response Body                             |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/orders`     | `{ "productId": 1, "qty": 2 }` | `{ "orderId": 123 }`                      |
| GET    | `/orders/123` | —                              | `{ "orderId": 123, "status": "Shipped" }` |

This tells consumers (like UI or another service) **what to send and what to expect**.

---

### 🛠 Tools for API Contracts

* **OpenAPI / Swagger** – For REST APIs
* **gRPC Protobufs** – For gRPC APIs
* **AsyncAPI** – For message-based communication
* **Postman / Stoplight** – For testing and documenting contracts
* **Pact** – For contract testing between services

---

### ✅ Benefits

* **Clear communication** between services
* **Early validation** of integrations
* **Safer changes** (breaking changes are avoided)
* **Contract testing** ensures compatibility
