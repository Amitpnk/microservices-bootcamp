Great question! Here's a **simple explanation** suitable for a class on **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**:

---

## ✅ What is an **Event**?

An **event** is a **fact** or **thing that has happened** in a system.

> It's a record of **something that occurred** in the past.

### 🔹 Example:

* "OrderPlaced"
* "UserRegistered"
* "PaymentFailed"

These are **immutable**, meaning once they happen, they don’t change.

---

## ✅ What is a **Message**?

A **message** is a **piece of data sent from one service to another** to communicate something — and it may **contain an event**.

> Messages are how services **talk to each other** — either by **sending commands** or **publishing events**.

### 🔹 Types of Messages:

* **Event message** – “An order was placed.”
* **Command message** – “Create an invoice.”
* **Query message** – “Get order status.”

## 🔄 Event vs Message (Side by Side)

| Aspect     | Event                               | Message                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| What it is | A record of something that happened | A communication between services |
| Direction  | Usually one-way (publish)           | One-way or request-response      |
| Example    | "OrderPlaced"                       | "CreateInvoiceCommand"           |
| Nature     | Passive (just notifies)             | Active (asks for something)      |

## 🧠 Summary:

* An **event** says: “Something happened.”
* A **message** says: “Here’s some info for you.”

In **event-driven systems**, services **emit events** and **consume events** using messages.

Let me know if you want to include **Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Azure Service Bus** in your examples.
